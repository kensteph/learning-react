What is a component?
A component is a bundle of markup, styles, and logic that controls everything about a specific part of the UI (User Interface).

Mechanism of reuse
Traditional HTML doesn't really have a way to reuse chunk of markup. Many languages use "partilas" to acheive this. A partial is a 
chunk of HTML that can be inserted into another HTML document.

-In CSS the main mechanism we have for reuse is the "class".
-In React, components are the main mechanism of reuse. Instead of partials for HTML, classes for CSS, and functions for JavaScript,
We create a component that bundles up all 3, and allows us to create a library of high-level reusable UI elements.
